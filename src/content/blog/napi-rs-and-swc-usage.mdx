## What is NAPI-RS?

NAPI-RS is a library written in Rust that is used to develop Node.js addons. This library allows developers to create high-performance applications and bridges the gap between JavaScript and Rust, enabling you to take advantage of the best features of both languages.

By combining Node.js with Rust, it is possible to develop large-scale, performance-oriented applications. NAPI-RS serves as a guide in this area, ensuring that code developed with Rust can work seamlessly with Node.js.

## My Contribution to SWC

SWC is a rapidly growing JavaScript/TypeScript compiler written in Rust. While contributing to SWC, I worked on making error formats configurable in the `minify_sync` function. This change provides flexibility in error reporting formats, giving developers more control.

### My Contribution: Making Error Formats Configurable

[Related PR](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/9441)

The contribution I made to the SWC project focuses on making error formats configurable. Hereâ€™s a summary of the changes:

- Added the `ErrorFormatConfig` enum to enable configuration of the `ErrorFormat` used in the `minify_sync` function.
- Updated the `minify_sync` function to accept an optional `error_format` parameter, which can be set to "normal," "json," or "color."
- If the `error_format` parameter is not provided, it defaults to `ErrorFormat::Normal`.
- This change makes error formats more flexible, allowing developers to choose different error formats based on their needs.

### Code Example

Below is an example of how the `minify_sync` function can be used:

```typescript
const result = minify_sync(codeBuffer, optsBuffer, "json");
