## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful platform that bridges the gap between JavaScript and C++ implementations. While working with the Node.js core or debugging specific issues, you may need to log data from both JavaScript and C++ layers. This guide explains how to achieve that using **LLDB**, a robust debugger for C++.

---

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure Node.js is built in debug mode to access debugging features.

### Building Node.js in Debug Mode

Run the following commands in your terminal to configure and build Node.js in debug mode:

```bash
./configure --debug --ninja
make
```

---

## Adding Logs in C++ Code

In Node.js core, you can use `std::cout` to log messages in the C++ layer. For example:

```cpp
std::cout << "read in c++" << std::endl;
```


path: `node/src/node_file.cc`

example:

```c++
static void Read(const FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>& args) {
  Environment* env = Environment::GetCurrent(args);

  std::cout << "read in c++" << std::endl; // Added log
  
  const int argc = args.Length();
  CHECK_GE(argc, 5);

```

This log will print whenever the related C++ function is executed, helping you trace the flow in the native layer.

---

## Adding Logs in JavaScript Code

In the JavaScript layer, you can add logs using `console.log`. For example:

```javascript
console.log('read in js');
```

path: `lib/fs.js`

example:

```javascript
function read(fd, buffer, offsetOrOptions, length, position, callback) {
  fd = getValidatedFd(fd);

   console.log('read in js'); // Added log

  let offset = offsetOrOptions;
  let params = null;
```

This will log messages to the console whenever this part of the JavaScript code is executed.

---

## Debugging with LLDB

After adding the logs, you can use **LLDB** to run and debug the Node.js application.

### Steps to Debug

1. **Launch LLDB**:
   ```bash
   lldb ./out/Release/node
   ```

2. **Set the Target**:
   ```bash
   target create "./out/Release/node"
   ```

3. **Run Your Test File**:
   Use the `run` command to execute a specific test file:
   ```bash
   run test/parallel/test-fs-read.js
   ```

4. **Observe Logs**:
   As the test runs, LLDB will display logs from both C++ and JavaScript layers.

### Example Output

Below is an example output showing logs from both layers:

```
read in c++
read in js
read in c++
read in js
read in c++
Process exited with status = 0 (0x00000000)
```

---

## Conclusion

By combining `std::cout` in C++ and `console.log` in JavaScript, you can effectively debug Node.js applications. Using LLDB, you can trace logs across both layers, making it easier to identify and resolve issues in your application.

Happy debugging!
