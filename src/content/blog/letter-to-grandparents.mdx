## A Letter to Grandpa and Grandma

I begin my words by asking: World, hello—why do you appear so merciless yet so ordinary?

To my revolutions—may they be eternal—from the light of my eyes to my heart, I love you so much. Your loving grandson, Mert.

I am currently twenty-six years old, losing days while trying to accomplish something—lazy, yet determined (I hope I am...).

Since childhood, I had dreams and I chased after them. You never once took a negative stance toward me; you always supported me. Grandpa was so happy when I studied and got into university...

As a child, I was quite mischievous. I played in the streets and fell constantly, always spraining my hands and feet. So it was perfectly natural for my family members to think I was a wild child who wouldn't finish school. I'm not angry with them at all, and I'm not arrogant...

## Living with Grandpa and Grandma

During high school, I stayed with Grandpa and Grandma. Actually, even as a child, I spent every weekend with them, but I won't start from there...

I was attending the second year of high school, and my family had moved from Istanbul to Muğla. So that my education wouldn't suffer an unstable period, I chose to stay in Istanbul with Grandpa and Grandma.

I was an enthusiastic boy. I was studying information technology, in the database programming branch. Not to brag, but I was successful in my classes, and I would receive Grandpa's "Well done, my lion" commendation.

## Memories of Grandpa

He was a man who lived by Atatürk's principles and was known for his fedora hat and the way he dressed. When I brought him brochures about Atatürk from school, he would be so happy.

Later, I started my internship. Now I had some money and could buy things economically. Since I knew he loved books, I would usually bring him books and calendars related to Atatürk. His eyes would light up, and he'd say, "Son, thank you, but don't spend your money."

When I did the grocery shopping for the house, they would be delighted, and I would feel proud—feeling like a child taking care of his home, in my own way.

## Memories of Grandma

Grandma would be so happy and call me "my dear son" with affection. Sometimes I'd go out with friends at night, and Grandma, with her protective instinct, would say, "Son, don't come home late." Grandpa, knowing my friends were good, would give permission, and I'd explore the beautiful districts of Istanbul—Taksim, Beşiktaş.

## Final Thoughts

I miss them and have never forgotten them. They're in my dreams. I imagine them both reunited in that beautiful era, and I am so happy for you.

I'm trying to do everything I can.

Your loving grandson, Mert.
